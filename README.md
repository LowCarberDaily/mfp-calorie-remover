# MyFitnessPal Calorie Column Remover
Remove the calorie column from your MyFitnessPal diary.

I had originally tossed together a couple of styles for my MyFitnessPal group. Since most of the group members already have Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey installed, I figured making it a script would be better. As an added bonus, this new and improved script only removes the calories column from the user's own diary, not that of their friends.

# Installing

**Chrome**: [Install Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en)
**Firefox**: [Install Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-Us/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)
Go to script: https://github.com/ShaunaGordon/mfp-calorie-remover/raw/master/mfpcalremover.user.js and click the install button
